# Cube-and-Ball
A Ball rotating around a cube

The slider on the right hand side, changes the angular velocity and the slider on the left affects the distance between cube and ball

If the cube is clicked on, the Cube and Ball both change colour to a random new colour.

Clicking on the Ball however, results in a scene reset.
